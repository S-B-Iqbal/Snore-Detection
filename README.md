# Snore Detection
The current Repository demonstrates how to detect Snoring using Ballistocardiography readings.

## Workflow

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis:    

 - Data analysis for Trends and Patterns from a Descriptive perspective.    
 
### 2. Statistical Analysis:  

   - 5 Point Summary: Stating the Mean, Median, Min, Mix and Standard Deviation of the Sample.
   - Feature Engineering: Created several features for future analysis based on stated Assumptions.
   - Descriptive Analysis:
        - I study the Data Visually, in order to generate Hypothesis.
   - Hypothesis Testing:
        - Based on the Hypothesis generated, I perform several statistical tests to reject/do not reject the Hypothesis.
### 3. Snore Detection:    

   - *Spindle Analysis:*
        - Spindle detection is performed from an 'Information' perspective.
   - *Loss Based Approach:*
        - Detection is performed with respect to pre-set threshold.
